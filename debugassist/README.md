# DebugAssist

**Augment your debugging workflow, don't automate it away.**

DebugAssist is a VS Code extension designed to help you understand *why* your code isn't working. Instead of just giving you a "fix" to copy-paste, DebugAssist provides contextual hints and analysis to help you grow as a developer.

Powerful, agentic AI tools like Cursor can abstract away the debugging process, limiting learning opportunities. Our tool offers a more balanced approach, providing targeted assistance to augment—not automate—a developer's understanding.

## 🚀 Features

- **Contextual Analysis**: Get help based specifically on the code you have selected.
- **Sidebar Integration**: A dedicated space for debugging conversations so you don't lose your place in the editor.
- **Targeted Insights**: Choose to focus on Errors, Optimizations, or Code Style using simple filters.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Open the **DebugAssist** icon in the Activity Bar (sidebar).
2. Highlight a block of code in your editor that is giving you trouble.
3. Type your question or specific concern in the sidebar text area.
4. Select which insights you want (Errors/Style/Optimizations) and hit **Analyze Code**.

## 🛡️ Why DebugAssist?

Unlike "agentic" AI tools that abstract away the problem-solving process, DebugAssist acts as a pair programmer. It points out the "gotchas" and logic gaps, ensuring you remain the pilot of your own codebase.

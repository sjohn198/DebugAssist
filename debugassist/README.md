Powerful, agentic AI tools like Cursor can abstract away the debugging process, limiting learning opportunities. Our tool offers a more balanced approach, providing targeted assistance to augment—not automate—a developer's understanding.

## Project overview

This repository contains DebugAssist — a VS Code extension that helps developers debug by offering contextual, targeted assistance rather than replacing the developer's problem-solving workflow. The workspace is a monorepo-like layout with three main parts:

- `debugassist/` — the VS Code extension (TypeScript). This is the main extension package you can run and package for the Marketplace.
- `webview-ui/` — the frontend UI that the extension loads into a WebView. Built with a Vite + React setup.
- `backend/` — an optional backend (Python) used by some features; includes an API and Dockerfile for local runs.

The extension is built using esbuild (via `build.ts`) and targets modern VS Code runtimes. Tests include unit (Mocha + Chai) and integration tests (using `@vscode/test-electron`). See `TESTING.md` for details.

## Features

- Lightweight, contextual debugging help surfaced in a sidebar webview.
- Commands to quickly grab the active editor contents and surface them to the assistant UI.
- Extensible provider architecture (see `src/providers/SidebarProvider.ts`).

## Quick start (development)

Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommend: 18.x or later)
- npm (bundled with Node)
- (Optional) Python 3.10+ if you plan to run the backend

Install dependencies for the workspace pieces you want to work on.

From the project root, to install everything you may run:

```bash
# Install extension dependencies
cd debugassist
npm install

# In another shell: install and run the webview UI dev server (if iterating on UI)
cd ../webview-ui
npm install
npm run dev

# Optional: backend
cd ../backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api.py
```

Build the extension (production build)

```bash
cd debugassist
npm run compile
```

Run the extension in the VS Code Extension Host

- Open the `debugassist/` folder in VS Code and press F5 to launch the Extension Development Host.

## Tests

Unit and integration tests live under the `debugassist` package. We use Mocha + Chai for unit tests and `@vscode/test-electron` for integration tests.

From `debugassist/`:

```bash
# Run unit tests only (fast)
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests (launches a test instance of VS Code)
npm run test:integration

# Run both
npm test
```

If you want a short guide to running tests and troubleshooting, see `TESTING.md` in the `debugassist/` folder.

## Project structure (high-level)

- `debugassist/`
  - `src/` — extension source code (providers, utilities, extension activation)
  - `out/` — compiled build outputs (generated by `npm run compile`)
  - `package.json` — extension package scripts & dependencies
  - `TESTING.md` — how to run tests locally
- `webview-ui/` — UI app used in the webview; supports dev server and production build
- `backend/` — optional Python backend used for APIs; contains `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Run and add unit tests for any new logic.
3. Keep integration tests small and focused on high-risk flows (activation, commands).
4. Open a PR with a clear description and link to failing/passing test results.

Code style

- The extension uses ESLint. Run `npm run lint` in `debugassist/` to validate style.

## CI

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that installs dependencies, runs `npm run compile` and executes `npm test`. Keep integration tests as a separate job or gated on main/PR to reduce noise.

## Troubleshooting

- If `@vscode/test-electron` can't download a VS Code build for integration tests: ensure network access and optionally set `VSCODE_VERSION` to a specific version.
- If unit tests fail because a module imports the `vscode` API at module load time, consider mocking `vscode` or splitting logic into pure functions that are easier to test.
